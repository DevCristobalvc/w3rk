## 🛠️ System Architecture

W3rk combines **AI + Web3** to create a trusted identity graph:

```
Wallet → Credential Extraction → AI CV Builder → On-Chain Credential Storage → Public Verifiable Profile
```

* Wallet connection imports on-chain history & digital credentials
* ASI agents build a professional narrative from onchain data
* Credentials & references are hashed + anchored on Hedera & Base
* Profiles are publicly verifiable, shareable & tamper-proof

## ✨ Inspired Innovation

Features inspired by CV builders like **Sabionet**, but Web3-native:

* Auto-extracts achievements from NFTs, transactions & DAO roles
* Real-time profile evolution as users earn new tokens or roles
* Agent-driven suggestions for career and network growth
* Decentralized identity + reputation that **you own**, not LinkedIn
